This repository contains all code for analyses for the paper "Unified nonparametric analysis of single-molecule spatial omics data using probabilistic indices" by Stijn Hawinkel, Xilan Yang, Ward Poelmans, Hans Motte, Tom Beeckman and Steven Maere. The methodology for analysing single-molecule and single-cell omics data is available in the R-package _smoppix_ on [BioConductor](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/smoppix/). It can be installed as:

```{r smoppix, eval = FALSE}
library(BiocManager)
install("smoppix")
```
