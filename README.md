=======

This repository contains all code for analyses for the paper “Unified
nonparametric analysis of single-molecule spatial omics data using
probabilistic indices” by Stijn Hawinkel, Xilan Yang, Ward Poelmans,
Hans Motte, Tom Beeckman and Steven Maere. The methodology for analysing
single-molecule and single-cell omics data is available in the R-package
*smoppix* on
