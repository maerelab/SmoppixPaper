This repository contains all code for analyses for the paper “Unified
nonparametric analysis of single-molecule spatial omics data using
probabilistic indices” by Stijn Hawinkel, Xilan Yang, Ward Poelmans,
Hans Motte, Tom Beeckman and Steven Maere, available from
[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.20.654270v2)
along with the data. The methodology for analysing single-molecule and
single-cell omics data is available in the R-package *smoppix* on
[BioConductor](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/smoppix/). It
can be installed as:

``` r
library(BiocManager)
install("smoppix")
```

The data generated in this study have been deposited to BioStudies with
